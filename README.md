Patchwork and gganimate Workshop

This is a set of two R notebooks demonstrating the basics of using the patchwork and gganimate packages for use in a workshop.  Here is how you can get started:


- The easiest way to do this is to fork or clone the repo for use on your machine. This assumes you have git/GitHub familiarity.
- You can download the repo.  If you do so, take the following steps.
  0. Download the repo.
  1. **Unzip** the contents to wherever you like (just note where you do)
  2. Open the folder and click the .Rproj file (blue icon).  This will open up the RStudio project.
  3. Open patchwork.Rmd and gganimate.Rmd notebooks.  You're ready for the workshop!
